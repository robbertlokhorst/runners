# Runners

Runners is a combination of the Speedrun.com and Twitch APIs using the Angular 2 framework.

You can search for games that have submitted runs on Speedrun.com. By doing this you get a list of players which submitted a run and have a Twitch account, but also a list which includes the players which are streaming at the moment. It's possible that the players aren't even streaming the game of your initial search request - they might not even speedrun at that moment. This way you can get more information about the runners themselves and get introduced to some new games.

## Why?

Speedrunning isn’t only about the games, it’s also about the players. Running the game takes months - sometimes even years - of blood, sweat and tears.

I’d like to shine a light on the runners. Give them the attention they deserve.

## To do

- ~~Show stream in a nice way;~~
- Show chat(?);
- ~~Join featured stream queries;~~
- ~~Don't load featured runners when searching for runners;~~
- ~~Include games from series in list (e.g. "Halo 2");~~ Speedrun.com's 'series' isn't what I thought it was..
- ~~Remove old files;~~
- ~~Filter double players;~~
- ~~Add header and footer;~~
- Animations;
- Put this bad boy online.
